# COMP-371 Team 9 Project

<hr />

We chose to do a simple tennis game simulation. To achieve this, we created a simple animation, using keyframes,
of 2 players playing tennis against each other in front of a crowd.

The animation is non-interactive, except for camera controls.

The basic animation is as follows: The blue-side player scores on the red-side player. Then the red player scores on the blue player.
Finally, both players volley the ball back and forth for a while until the blue player finally scores.

Each time a player scores, their respective scoreboard increments an appropriate amount according to the rules of tennis.
In addition, a crowd sound plays, indicating cheering.

There is a constant murmur of crowd noise throughout the scene to make it more realistic.

The crowd sounds are composed of 2 male crowds and 2 female crowds. One side has the male crowd sounds and vice-versa.
When a player scores, a random crowd sound from their appropriate sound bank plays.

In addition, when a racket hits a ball, a random ball sound plays. There are 3 possible ball sounds.

## Controls

 - arrow left - Rotate the world about the positive X axis
 - arrow right - Rotate the world about the negative X axis
 - arrow up - Rotate the world about the positive Y axis
 - arrow down - Rotate the world about the negative Y axis
 - P - Render model as points
 - L - Render model as lines
 - T - Render model as triangles
 - HOME - Resets projection, view, world matrices to initial position
 - Mouse button left - Movement with left mouse button up/ down will tilt the camera
 - Mouse button right - Movement with right mouse button left/ right will pan the camera
 - Mouse Button Middle - Movement up/ down will zoom in and out the camera

## Screenshots

Here, we can see a sample moment in the animation, it looks like the blue player is winning:

![Sample moment](src/Screenshots/A%20moment%20in%20the%20animation.png)

The ball is green and has a grass-like texture to it:

![Ball texture](src/Screenshots/Ball.png)

The arms hold the racket with fingers that curl and uncurl automatically. Look at that cool glove:

There are lots of people watching the game. Can you hear their talking when you watch the animation?
The colors are all randomly-generated each time the animation is played

Here's another view from the bleachers

The field has a dirt-like texture and the court has a grass-like texture:

There are also 3 particularly enamoured fans near the court. They gradually walk around.
Their colors are also randomly-generated each time. This shot also showcases the ball bouncing:

The scoreboard increments in groups of 15 per tennis scoring rules. One side is the blue player, the other is the red player:

Here's the scene without any shadows:

And finally, here's a pretty cool angle you can get if you move the camera around with the arrow keys:
