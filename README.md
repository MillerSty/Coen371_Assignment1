Accepted input:
W - positive y movement
Shift+ A - Positve x movement
S - Negative y movement
Shift + D - Negative x movement
U - Scale up
J - Scale down
a / d - pressing a or d allows for model rotation about y axis
SPACE - will randomly reposition model inside viewing area
arrow left - rotate  world about positive x axis
arrow right - rotate world about -ve x axis
arrow up - rotate    world about positive y axis
arrow down - rotate  world  about negative y axis
P - render model as points
L - render model as lines
T- Render model as triangles
HOME - resets projection, view, world matrix to initial position
Mouse button left- Movement with left mouse button up/down will tilt the camera
Mouse button right - Movement with right mouse button left/right will pan the camera
Mouse Button Middle - Movement up/down will zoom in and out the camera

Checklist of Functionality:
[x] 1 model needs upper and lower arm, ideally independent of eachother
[x] 2: grid needs to be 100 x 100
[x] 3: coord needs to be 5 grids long in each direction
[x] 4: GLFW 1024x 768, using perspective view and backface culling [-> res is set, should be set in perspective, and backface cullin enabled]
[x] 5: pressing spacebar should move model  to random grid location
[x] 6: U scales up hand ; J scales down -> small increments
[x] 7: Move model positions WASD for direction ;
[x] 7.1 : a d for rotation about y axis (5 degrees)
[x] 8: World orientation using (left arrow -> Rx) ; (right arrow -> R -x ) ; (up arrow -> Ry) ; (down arrow -> R -y) 
			Rx denotes a small anti-clockwise
			rotation about positive x axis, R-x about negative x axis, etc
[x] 8.1: home reset to initial position and orientation  
[x] 9: User can change rendering mode for the model ie: points, line, triangles based on keyboard input (P L T)
[x] 10: Pan and tilt camerea -> tilt being move the camera up and down
			mouse right button is pressed → use mouse movement in x direction to pan;
			mouse middle button is pressed → use mouse movement in y direction to tilt.
[x] 11: Camera zoom in and out of the scene - while  mouse left button is pressed → mouse movement to move into/out of the scene

Possible Addons:
ADDON: rotate forearm independently
ADDON: E and W for z axis
ADDON: Mouse scroll zoom and mouse movement pan/tilt
